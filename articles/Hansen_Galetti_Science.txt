The Forgotten Megafauna

An expanded megafauna concept elucidates how extinctions of the largest vertebrates in any ecosystem have similar effects.

An extended megafauna concept has the potential to promote synergy between otherwise disparate research and conservation foci, and to facilitate broader syntheses of ecosystem-level effects of extinctions of the largest vertebrates and the resulting ecological shrinkage. It is high time to more fully understand and ameliorate the recent and ongoing losses of all "the hugest, and fiercest, and strangest forms" (13).

Automating Science
