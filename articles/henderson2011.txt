Abstract--A recent phylogenetic study based on molecular data indicates that Licúala (Arecaceae: Palmae) is not monophyletic. A highly supported group of species is resolved separately from Licúala and the rest of the Livistoninae, and is closely related to Joliannesteijsniannia, requiring that the segregate group be placed in a new genus. In this study, a phylogeny based on seven gene regions resolves highly supported generic relationships of the Livistoninae. A survey of Licúala specimens from several herbaria indicates that, based on morphology, eight species should be recognized within this genus. A complete description of the new genus, Lanonia, is given. A review of morphology distinguishes synapomorphies in leaf morphology and dioecy of Lanonia species. All eight species are described with complete synonymy, their distributions are mapped, and lists of specimens examined are given. One species occurs in Hainan, one in Java, and six are endemic or nearly endemic to Vietnam. The following new combinations are made: L. acaulis, L. calciphila, L. centralis, L. dasyantha, L. gracilis, L. hainanensis, L. hexasepala, and L. magalonii.

Single amplifications of the matK locus used primers matK-19F and matK-1862R, with internal sequencing for matK-300F, matK-809F, and matK-971R to construct contiguous sequences (Steele and Vilgalys 1994; Asmussen et al. 2006).

For Bayesian MCMC analysis (Yang and Rannala 1997), data was partitioned by locus to allow for variation in substitution models in the BEAST package (Drummond et al. 2006; Drummond and Rambaut 2007). The analysis was run using a strict molecular clock model, a Yule pure birth speciation model, the GTR + T model of nucleotide substitution, and the default operator. The Markov chains were run for 10 million generations and repeated 10 times to test for MCMC chain convergence and to check effective sample sizes, which all exceeded 1,000. After removing an a priori determined 10% burn-in, BEAST log files were combined in LogCombiner v.l.5.4 to determine whether chains had reached stationarity in Tracer vl.5. Tree files were combined to estimate mean node height and the 95"/n highest posterior density in TreeAnnotator v.1.5.4.
Morphological Analysis--A survey of the morphology of specimens of both Lanonia and Licúala was carried out. Specimens were examined from the following herbaria: A, AAU, BH, F, Fl, FIPI, HN, HNU, IBSC, K, M, MO, NY, P, SYS, US, and VNM. Relevant literature was also surveyed (e.g. Saw 1997; Barfod and Saw 2002; Saw et al. 2003).

posterior probability (PP; Fig. 2). The inter-generic relationships were congruent among the gene trees except for the position of Pholidocarpus, but the incongruences were all poorly supported (< 75% branch support). Within Lanonia, L. calciphila is resolved as sister to the rest of the genus in the ttdliF and RPB2 gene trees (62% and 97% IK respectively), but not in the CISP4 gene tree (85%). The position of Lanonia sp. AH3590 as sister to Lanonia sp. AH3726 and AH3727 is supported by both the matK (54% JK) and RPB2 gene trees (64% IK), but not by the CISPs 4 and 5 gene trees (85% and 63'X, respectively). The individuals Lanonia sp. AH3676 and AH3695 are sister in both the ndhP and matK gene trees (66% and 59% JK), but are separated by two weakly supported branches in the MS gene tree (60% and 50% JK). Lastly, in the CISP5 gene tree, L. acaulis is resolved as sister to L. hainanensis (58% JK), but not in the CISP4 or MS gene trees (85% and 60% JK respectively). These incongruences were maintained after resequencing of the individuals in question for the respective genes.
Systematics Within Livistoninae and Lanonia Based on Molecular Phylogenetics--The multilocus phylogeny resolved Livistona as sister to all remaining species in the subtribe (95% JK and 84% BS), a clade of Licúala + Pltolidocarptts + Saribus (86% JK and 81% BS), and the sister relationship of Johannesteijsmamtia and Lanonia (99% JK and BS). Within Lanonia weakly supported relationships were resolved between L. hexasepala and L. sp. (AH3688 and AH3703; 57% JK and 62% BS) as well as between the Latiotiia sp. individuals AH3590, AH3726, and AH3727 (68% JK and 60% BS).
Bayesian methods can be sensitive to missing data (e.g. Goloboff and Pol 2005) and to inflated branch-support values (e.g. Suzuki et al. 2002; Simmons et al. 2004). In the Bayesian

Notes--Licúala gracilis was included as a synonym of L. pumila by Beccari (1933) and this was followed by Backer and Bakhuizen van den Brink (1968). It was not until Dransfield recollected it in Ujung Kulon in 1971 that the distinctness of Blume's L. gracilis was recognized, and it is currently accepted as a species distinct from L. pumila (Govaerts and Dransfield
