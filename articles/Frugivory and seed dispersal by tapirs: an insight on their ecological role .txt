17 18

19 Tapirs are one of the last extant megafauna species that survived the Pleistocene extinctions. Given their size 19

20 and digestive system characteristics, tapirs might be the last potential seed disperser of plant species that were 20

21 previously dispersed by other large mammal species that are now extinct. We compiled evidence from 39 pub- 21

22 lished scientific studies showing that tapirs have a key role as seed dispersers and seed predators. Tapirs play 22

23 an important role either through seed predation or by facilitating the recruitment of seeds over long distances, 23

24 therefore influencing the diversity of plant species in the ecosystem. Neotropical tapirs might have a unique role 24

25 as long-distance seed dispersers of large seeds (<20 mm) because they are capable of depositing viable large 25

26 seeds in favorable places for germination that even large-bodied primates cannot disperse. Given the high diver- 26

27 sity of seed species found in tapir diet, more information is needed on the identification of seed traits that allow 27

28 the survival of seeds in the tapir's gut. Moreover, further studies are necessary on the role of tapirs as seed dis- 28

29 persers and predators; in particular considering spatial patterns of dispersed seeds, seed viability, effect of dung, 29

30 and seed density in tapir latrines, and the effect of deposition sites on germination and seedling survival. Be- 30

31 cause all tapir species are highly threatened, it is paramount to identify gaps in our knowledge on the ecological 31

32 role of tapirs and, in particular, on critical and endangered plant­tapir interactions to avoid possible trophic cas- 32

33 cading effects on ecosystem function.

shaping the structure of plant communities at differ- 43

are able to ingest more fruits, eat larger seeds and dis- 45

perse them to larger distances than small bodied frugi- 46

of these megafrugivores is the tapir (Tapirus spp., Peris- 48

tween 50 000 and 10 000 years ago (Koch & Barnosky 2006). Tapirs (Tapiridae) are among the most primitive extant large mammals (Feldhamer et al. 2007). At least 22 species of tapirs were known between the Oligocene and the Pleistocene and were distributed worldwide (Janis 1984). Today, there are only 4 extant tapir species, all of them included in the genus Tapirus. Of these, 3 species are distributed in the American continent, Baird's tapir [Tapirus bairdii (Gill, 1865)], the lowland tapir [Tapirus terrestris (Linnaeus, 1758)] and the mountain tapir [Tapirus pinchaque (Roulin, 1829)], and 1 in Asia, the Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus Desmarest, 1819). All tapir species are considered threatened by poaching, fragmentation and habitat loss (see www.redlist.org), so it is paramount to understand their role in forest succession and regeneration.
In the present study, we review the role of tapirs in the seed dispersal process. In particular, we look for broad scale patterns and particularities that could explain their frugivorous habits in different environments, the effects of tapir gut passage on seed viability and the spatial seed deposition patterns provided by tapirs. Ultimately, we show that the fruit diet of tapirs varies among ecosystems and populations with no clear pattern. We identify gaps in our knowledge that are key for the understanding of the importance of the ecological role of tapirs and the potential consequences of their extinction.

and, therefore, are potential seed dispersers and preda- 1

tors (Bodmer 1990; Rodrigues et al. 1993; Fragoso & 2

Huffman 2000; Tobler et al. 2010). The relative occur- 3

rence of fruits in the tapir's diet ranges from 3% in Gua- 4

temala for the Baird's tapir (García-Vettorazzi 2006) to 5

33% in the Amazonian Peru for the lowland tapir (Bod- 6

mer 1991; Fig. 1). The low relative occurrence of fruits 7

in the tapir diet might be associated with the availabili- 8

ty of fallen fruits, season, productivity, competition with 9

other ungulates (e.g. peccaries) and fruit selection; how- 10

ever, further studies are necessary to identify the factors 11

that influence the degree of frugivory of tapirs along 12

their distribution range.

PLANT DIVERSITY

15 16

The diversity of plant species dispersed is an impor- 17

tant component of the community-level effectiveness 18

of a seed disperser (Bascompte et al. 2003; Dennis & 19

Westcott 2006). Tapirs consume a wide variety of plant 20

species (Schupp et al. 2010), which might be determin- 21

ing their variable role as seed dispersers and predators 22

among habitats and populations (Table 1). For instance, 23

lowland tapirs have been reported to eat more than 460 24

plant species in the Neotropical region, with fruits from 25

194 plant species (Hibert et al. 2011), many of which 26

are not dispersed by Ateline primates. For Baird's tapir, 27

seeds of as many as 81 species (33 families) have been 28

reported in tapir dung, with 67 species reported with vi- 29

FRUGIVORY

able or intact seeds (Table S1). In French Guiana, Hi- 30 bert et al. (2011) found 42 identified and 16 unidenti- 31

The relative occurrence of fruits versus plant vegetative parts in tapir diet varies among habitats, biomes and populations; however, all tapir species eat fruits,

fied fruit species as part of the lowland tapir; however, 32 the fate of the seeds in the dung is not reported. In the 33 most comprehensive study to date, Downer (2001) stud- 34

33 and found that they consumed as many as 205 plant spe-

34 cies and seeds from 86 species (or 32.6% of the vascu-

35 lar plants recorded in the study area) germinated from

36 tapirs' dung (Table 2).

37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47

The high variation in fruit consumption by tapirs might be explained by forest productivity. Nevertheless, Oliveira (2011) did not find any relation between number of species eaten by lowland tapirs and forest productivity, or any abiotic variable (rainfall and temperature; Table 1). However, further studies are necessary with other tapir species. In particular, studies on the relationship between species diversity in the field and diversity of seeds dispersed by tapirs are necessary to identify possible patterns of fruit choice and preference.

48 Despite the high diversity of seeds reported in tapirs'

49 dung or as dispersed by tapirs, only a few studies eval-

50 uate the germination probabilities of the seeds found in

51 the dung (i.e. Janzen 1982a; O'Farrill et al. 2012). We

focus the present study on all the reports on tapir diet and assume that tapirs potentially disperse the seeds found in tapir dung (meaning seeds can germinate in their deposition sites). However, further conclusions on the seed dispersal role of tapirs should consider the fate of the seeds dispersed.
Future studies should focus on the distribution of the most commonly represented families of the seeds found in tapir dung to evaluate whether the variability of seeds in dung represents the variability of family species along the distribution range of tapirs. We established that the species found in dung and reported as dispersed in the literature corresponded to 46 families for the lowland tapir, 34 families for the Baird's tapir and 14 families for the mountain tapir (Fig. S1). The family Rubiaceae was the most common family represented in the species reported as dispersed by the Baird's tapir (10 species). This family also represented one of the most common families in the lowland tapir dispersed species (29 spe-

ed in the species dispersed by the lowland tapir (36 spe- dung in a semi deciduous forest. In the Yucatan Penin- 30

cies). For the mountain tapir, the Asteraceae family was the most represented (4 species), followed by Poaceae (3 species).
Even though tapirs have been documented to have mutualistic interactions with the large-seeded plant species they disperse, further study is required on plant species with potential tapir syndromes (e.g. with large seeds, falling to the ground at maturity and using smell to attract dispersers) to evaluate their dependency on tapirs for recruitment (Janzen & Martin 1982; Guimãraes et al. 2008; Donatti et al. 2011).
SEED SIZE CONSUMPTION
Tapirs can ingest small seeds (e.g. those of Ficus spp. approximately 1 mm) and large seeds, varying in size from 20­30 mm (Spondias mombim and Manilkara zapota) up to mango seeds (Mangifera spp. >50 mm; Fragoso & Huffman 2000). Tapirs can ingest and defecate a large number of even large seeds (Janzen 1982b; Williams 1984). For example, in Brazil, Galetti et al.

sula in Mexico, a single dung pile of a Baird's tapir con- 31

tained up to forty 20 mm long M. zapota seeds (O'Farrill 32

et al. 2012), while in Brazil, Rodrigues et al. (1993) 33

found 300 seeds of Euterpe edulis, each measuring 8­14 34

mm. In a study in Taman Negara National Park, Malay- 35

sia, fruit parts and seeds were present in all but one of 36

the Malayan tapir dung piles inspected (the number of 37

piles is unknown). These included many species, with 38

a fruit diameter ranging from 10 to 60 mm (Williams & 39

Petrides 1980). Unfortunately, most of these species re- 40

mained unidentified.

41

We compiled the information available on the seed 42

sizes of species found in tapir dung (N = 156). In most 43

studies, seeds found in tapir dung are reported as dis- 44

persed despite that no germination or viability tests con- 45

firmed the status of the seeds. In addition, only the spe- 46

cies names are reported and no data is presented on the 47

number of seeds per plant species in most studies. We 48

found that most of the seeds that had been reported as dispersed by tapirs are small: 66% of the species corresponded to seeds 10 mm, 21% to seeds between 10 and

seeds larger than 30 mm (Fig. 2). This high percentage of small seeds remains when observing seed sizes by tapir species: 61% of the seeds where 10 mm for Baird's tapir and 66% for the lowland tapir. In French Guiana, Henry et al. (2000) found a similar pattern for the low-

28 land tapir, where 67% of 40 seed species were <10 mm

29 in diameter. Even though tapirs might not be dispers-

30 ing a high diversity of large-seeded plant species, their

31 unique role as dispersers of large seeds should not be

32 underestimated, especially in those habitats where there

33 are no redundant species.

34

35 SEED PREDATORS VERSUS SEED

36 37

DISPERSERS

38 Tapirs can spit or accidentally drop many seeds from

39 the fruits they eat (Janzen 1982b; Bodmer 1991; Campos-

40 Arceiz et al. 2012); however, the fate of those seeds

41 is commonly ignored. Of those seeds that are actually

42 swallowed, many do not survive the passage through the

43 guts; some are crushed during mastication or destroyed

44 45 46

by gastric acids and excessive hydration in tapirs' guts (Janzen 1981; Campos-Arceiz et al. 2012).

47 There is controversy regarding the role of tapirs as ei-

48 ther disperser or predator for certain plant species. For

49 example, in a feeding trial with a captive Baird's tapir,

50 Janzen (1981) found that the tapir's digestive process

51 killed 78 and 100% of guanacaste (Enterolobium cyclo-

carpum) and carao (Cassia grandis) seeds, respectively. In contrast, Williams (1984) found live carao seeds in tapir dung in Santa Rosa National Park in Costa Rica. Also in Costa Rica, Baird's tapir predated M. zapota seeds (Janzen 1982a; Williams 1984), while in Mexico viable M. zapota seeds were observed in several Baird's tapir dung piles (O'Farrill et al. 2012). Campos-Arceiz et al. (2012) found that seeds ingested by captive Malayan tapirs showed survival rates ranging from 0 to 50% for different species. Although tapirs can act both as seed predators or seed dispersers, even within plant species, further study is necessary to understand what seed traits determine the survival of seeds in the tapir gut.
TAPIR EFFECTIVENESS IN THE
DISPERSAL OF LARGE SEEDS
Effective seed dispersal includes the movement of viable seeds to favorable places for germination and the successful survival of the seeds and establishment of adult individuals (Harper 1977). Tapirs have been reported as effective seed dispersers of large seeds: for example, Mauritia flexuosa and Maximiliana maripa palms in Costa Rica (Bodmer 1991; Fragoso & Huffman 2000), M. zapota in Mexico (O'Farrill et al. 2012) and Syagrus romanzoffiana in Argentina (Giombini et al. 2009; Table 3). However, the role of tapirs as seed dispersers needs to be compared with their role as seed

predators for a particular plant species and the effects of seed presence in tapir dung might overestimate the seed 1

the location where seeds are deposited should be con- dispersal role of these species. In Kerinci Seblat, Suma- 2

sidered. For example, in the Calakmul region in Mexico, only 53% of 345 dung piles collected between 2005 and 2008 contained intact M. zapota seeds (large seeds length >20 mm) or seedlings (G. O'Farrill, unpubl. data). In addition, the same authors found that in 164 dung piles analyzed, 54% of the seeds were intact while 46% were predated (O'Farrill et al. 2006), suggesting that tapirs play a significant role both in the seed dispersal and seed predation of M. zapota seeds. However, O'Farrill et al. (2012) found that of 512 M. zapota seeds collected from tapir dung, only 30% germinated, suggesting that reports on seed dispersal by tapirs based only on

tra, Malayan tapirs consumed large fruits, such as jack- 3

fruits (Artocarpus sp.) and durians (Durio sp.), and duri- 4

an seedlings were often found sprouting from tapir dung 5

(Holden et al. 2003). In contrast, a study with captive 6

tapirs showed that although Malayan tapirs readily con- 7

sume large fruits, such as Artocarpus integer, very few 8

large seeds survive to passage through their guts (Campos-Arceiz et al. 2012). Even though tapirs might predate a vast amount of large seeds, the dispersal of just a few large seeds to favorable places for germination and

9 10 11 12 13

survival might enhance the recruitment of large-seeded 14

plant species not dispersed by other animal species.

1 TAPIR EFFECTS ON SEED

2 3

RECRUITMENT

4 Tapirs defecate seeds in a large amount of dung that

5 can act as fertilizer in the early stages of seedling devel-

6 opment. In Mexico, germination of M. zapota seeds col-

7 lected from tapir dung was significantly higher when

8 planted in tapir dung than when planted in soil near wa-

9 ter ponds commonly frequented by tapirs, suggesting a

10 positive effect of tapir dung on germination (O'Farrill et

11 al. 2012).

12 Dung can also act as a physical protection against

13 predation by bruchid beetles, as reported by Fragoso et

14 al. (2003), and can attract other seed predators, such as

15 hyacinth macaws in Pantanal (M. Galetti, unpubl. data).

16 17

In addition, secondary seed dispersal from tapir dung can influence the fate of the dispersed seeds. In Bolivia,

18 predation of Attalea phalerata seeds by bruchid beetles

19 was significantly lower when seeds were planted in ta-

20 pir dung than when seeds were left exposed or partially

21 covered (Rios & Pacheco 2006).

In addition, tapirs have been described to defecate repeatedly in latrines (Acosta et al. 1996; Fragoso & Huffman 2000; Holden et al. 2003), but this behavior does not seem to be universal. Based on molecular analysis, researchers have found that several individuals can use the same latrine (A. Sanches, unpubl. data). Therefore, defecation in latrines can increase the concentration of seeds and result in higher density-dependent mortality. In the Pantanal, tapirs are known to defecate in saltwater lakes (salinas), where seeds are unable to recruit. However, many seeds are also dispersed in latrines in the forests and cerrado vegetation (M. Galetti, unpubl. data). In conclusion, the advantages and disadvantages of the creation of latrines by tapirs and their seed dispersal role remain unclear.

38 It has been documented that tapirs have a tendency to

39 defecate in water, a hostile environment for the surviv-

40 al and establishment of most seeds. However, it is un-

41 clear how widespread this behavior is. For example, in

42 Costa Rica, Janzen (1981) concluded that Baird's tapirs

43 defecated exclusively in water or in dry areas that flood

44 seasonally, while in Mexico, dung piles of this same

45 species were found both in inundated areas and in sites

46 never reached by water (G. O'Farrill, pers. observ.). In

47 Venezuela, lowland tapirs were observed to defecate ex-

48 clusively in flooded or seasonally flooded areas (Salas

49 & Fuller 1996). In contrast, Fragoso (1997) found low-

50 land tapir latrines at upland forest sites in Brazil. Also in

51 Brazil, Talamoni and Assis (2009) found tapir dung in

water, suggesting the deposition of seeds in hostile environments.
TAPIRS' EFFECTS AT A LANDSCAPE
LEVEL
The spatial distribution of dispersed seeds by tapirs is determined by the time the seeds are retained in the animal guts (i.e. time from consumption to defecation) and by the animal's movement in that time (Jordano et al. 2007; Morales & Carlo 2006). Janzen (1981) found that bigger seeds are retained longer than small seeds in tapir guts, with retention times varying from 48 to 52 h. A recent study with captive lowland and Malayan tapirs showed mean fluid and particle retention times ranging from 25 to 81 h (Clauss et al. 2010). Feeding trials with Malayan tapirs using seeds of 9 different plant species showed mean retention times of up to 13 days for some large seeds (Campos-Arceiz et al. 2012). This shows that tapirs have relatively long retention times for their body size. For instance, the seeds of Tamarindus indica eaten by Malayan tapirs are retained 4 times longer than by Asian elephants (Elephas maximus Linnaeus, 1758) (Campos-Arceiz et al. 2008).
Having long gut retention times can have a positive and negative effect on seed survival. This can cause more seeds to be predated by the gut fluids but can favor the dispersal of seeds farther away from parent trees, therefore reducing density-dependent mortality and promoting large-scale processes such as fragment connectivity, re-colonization of disturbed patches and plant migration (e.g. as a result to climate change).
In addition to long gut retention times, tapir movement patterns determine the spatial pattern of seed dispersal. Tapirs have large home ranges, although smaller than expected by their body size. For example, in Peru, Tobler et al. (2009) reported lowland tapir individuals moving up to 13 km in 24 h periods, with a mean daily movement of 5.2 km (range 3.6­6.7 km). These movements over long distances or through large home ranges allow tapirs to move seeds over many kilometers, spacing the seeds in the tapir's dung (Janzen 1981), and, therefore maximizing seed dispersal effectiveness and increasing the probability of the deposition of seeds in favorable places for germination (far from parent trees where density-dependent competition occurs). Hence, tapirs can facilitate the regeneration of several plant species and the maintenance of their populations on a large scale, as reported by Fragoso (1997) in Brazil, where the large-scale aggregation of Ma. maripa palms might

result from the defecation characteristics of tapirs. Talamoni and Assis (2009) found several dense clumps of Psidium myrtoides (a tapir-dispersed seed) located next to rivers, which suggests that tapirs, among other dispersers, might be influencing the distribution of this particular plant species. Bueno (2010) showed that lowland tapirs move across open or highly degraded areas not suitable for primates or other arboreal frugivores, therefore ensuring the dispersal of seeds across the landscape.
UNIQUENESS OF TAPIRS
All species of tapirs are locally threatened, due to overexploitation, habitat loss and road kill (Castellanos et al. 2008; Diaz et al. 2008; Lynam et al. 2008; Naveda et al. 2008). Today, tapirs represent the largest mammal of a once highly diverse megafauna in the Neotropical region. Although some regions still support large abundances of tapirs, most of their populations are declining.
Tapirs are seed dispersers and seed predators of a wide variety of plant species, therefore influencing the dynamics of plant populations. Given their frugivorous habits, tapirs consume small and large seeds, which are moved over long distances. However, given their size, long gut retention times, large home ranges and defecation patterns, tapirs might be the only species capable of dispersing large-seeded plants over long distances and to favorable places for germination. Therefore, tapirs might have a unique role as long-distance seed dispersers of large-seeded plants. The deposition of seeds in favorable places helps to maintain plant populations in both the short term and on a large scale. For example, Giombini et al. (2009) found that S. romanzoffiana seeds were present in 98% of dung piles observed in Argentina, and that dung piles showed a clumped deposition pattern, reflecting the use of latrines and influencing the distribution of seedlings. Fragoso et al. (2003) found that the aggregated pattern of Ma. maripa palms in Brazil was associated with tapir latrine sites, suggesting that tapirs might be shaping the distribution patterns of the species they disperse.
Even though most of the large-seeded plant species reported as dispersed by tapirs are consumed by other frugivore species (e.g. peccaries, spider and howler monkeys; Donatti et al. 2011; Table 4); it remains unclear whether other potential dispersers are capable of transporting viable seeds over long distances, as most studies do not test for viability or germination probabilities. For example, M. zapota seeds are reported as

uniquely dispersed by tapirs in the Yucatan Peninsu- 1

la in Mexico (O'Farrill et al. 2012). Other potential dis- 2

persers in the area are howler monkeys (Alouatta pig- 3

ra Lawrence, 1933), but this species has been observed 4

to spit out M. zapota seeds (S. Calmé, pers. comm.). In 5

a study in French Guiana, Ratiarison and Forget (2011) 6

report that even though Alouatta seniculus (Linnaeus, 7

1766) and Ateles paniscus (Linnaeus, 1758) swallowed 8

M. huberi seeds, their sedentary behavior causes the dis- 9

persal of seeds only over short distances. Cebus apel- 10

la Linnaeus, 1758 and Saguinus midas Linnaeus, 1758 11

were often observed in Man. bidentata crowns; howev- 12

er, these species spit out the seeds. This suggests that for 13

Manilkara spp. seeds, tapirs might act as the sole long- 14

distance seed dispersers. Further comparative studies 15

are necessary to evaluate the role of tapirs as long-dis- 16

tance seed dispersers of other large-seeded species in 17

comparison with other potential seed dispersers in the 18

Neotropics. In Asia, tapirs might not play a unique role 19

as long-distance seed dispersers as other larger mammals 20

disperse large-seeded plants. For example, Campos- 21

Arceiz et al. (2012) found that Malayan tapirs effective- 22

ly dispersed small-seeded plants but acted as seed pred- 23

ators for large-seeded plants (e.g. Artocarpus integer, 24

seed length >20 mm).

25

Perhaps the main difference between the role of 26 Asian tapirs and their North, Central and South Ameri- 27 can counterparts in seed dispersal effectiveness is a mat- 28 ter of context (Hansen & Galetti 2009). In Southeast 29 Asia, Malayan tapirs are one order of magnitude small- 30 er than the largest seed dispersers (i.e. Asian elephants). 31 In the Neotropics, in contrast, tapirs are the largest liv- 32 ing seed dispersers. This confers American tapirs a more 33 unique role in the dispersal of large-seeded plants and 34 long-distance dispersal events. In Southeast Asia, how- 35 ever, if the loss of very large mammals continues un- 36 abated, Malayan tapirs are expected to acquire in the fu- 37 ture a relatively more important role as seed dispersers. 38

species other than tapirs. Tapirs consume high quantities 51

Frugivory by tapirs

of seeds, many of which are predated, causing the depletion of seedling abundance or promoting seed dispersal of those seeds that survive the digestive system (Gill 2006); hence, their loss can cause a cascade of ecological effects on other species interacting with the plant species tapirs consume (Giombini et al. 2009). In the Sangay National Park in Ecuador, Downer (2001) found a positive correlation between tapirs' feeding preferences for plant species and their germination frequency in dung, suggesting that mountain tapirs might be exerting a positive influence in their habitat by helping to regenerate their preferred food items. In the Brazilian Pantanal, a long-term community study found that plants dispersed by large mammals (particularly tapirs) form a distinct subset in the community, suggesting the irreplaceable role of these mammals on seed dispersal processes (Donatti et al. 2011). Therefore, the extinction of tapirs or changes in their movement patterns due to human-driven changes would result in a reduction of the quality and quantity of dispersal for many plants. For example, according to Galetti et al. (2001), the removal of lowland tapir from its habitat would have deleterious consequences for 50 out of 1380 Atlantic forest plant species, especially those with large seeds. Further studies on the potential consequences of tapir-defaunated or low tapir population sites are necessary to prevent a cascade of ecological effects. The decline of animal-mediated seed dispersal results in an increased dominance of winddispersed species (Muller-Landau & Hardesty 2005). Therefore, it is of great relevance to understand the ecological role of tapirs and to guarantee their conservation as functional elements of the very ecosystems they inhabit. In addition, future decisions on the conservation of tapir populations and their habitat areas require actions based on the information gathered in field studies.
Tapirs are important given their unique evolution and their role in promoting the coexistence of species by controlling recruitment (eating seedlings or seeds) and by promoting the seed dispersal of many species. Despite their endangered status all along their distribution range, the information available on their ecology, populations and the interactions with other species is limited. Further studies on tapirs are necessary, especially those focused on the ecological cascade effects on tapir defaunated sites and on the ecological consequences of the disruption of their movement patterns.
