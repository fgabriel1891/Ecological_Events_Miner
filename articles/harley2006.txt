Of all monocotyledons the Arecaceae displays by far the richest fossil record, and there is an extensive literature. The earliest unequivocal fossil palm material probably dates from the early to mid Late Cretaceous (Turonian > Coniacian > Santonian). The records are geographically widespread and comprise a wide range of organs: leaves, cuticles, stems, rhizomes, roots, fruits, seeds, endocarps, rachillae, peduncles, inflorescences, individual flowers and pollen. For some of these organs records are rare while for others, such as leaves, stems and pollen, records are abundant. However, fossil material often lacks sufficient diagnostic detail to allow reasonable association with living palm taxa beyond, or even to, subfamilial level. Nevertheless, many fossil genera and numerous species have been described. A brief survey of palm fossil records is presented, and their taxonomy and morphological limitations are considered. © 2006 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2006, 151, 39­67.

INTRODUCTION
The fossil record of Arecaceae is both rich and widespread. Chronologically, the expanding and retracting distribution of fossil palm records in higher latitudes has been an important indicator of global change, particularly cooling events during the early Miocene. Fossil records also show that the continent of Africa and the subcontinent of India once possessed much richer palm floras than at present. Leaves, stems and pollen are particularly abundant in the fossil record, but there are also numerous records of fruits and seeds, rhizomes and roots. Rarely, rachillae, inflorescences or individual flowers are recovered.
The earliest unequivocal fossils are from the late mid-Cretaceous to early Upper Cretaceous. These consist of costapalmate leaves: Sabalites carolinensis Berry (Berry, 1914a) from the late Coniacian­early Santonian of South Carolina to the Santonian of New Jersey (USA); S. magothiensis (Berry) Berry (Berry,

1905, 1911) and Sabalites longirhachis (Unger) J. Kvadek et Herman (Kvadek & Herman, 2004) from the Lower Campanian of Austria. Pinnate leaves are first described from the Lower Campanian of northern Montana (Phoenicites Brongniart; Crabtree, 1987). The earliest record of fossil stems, Palmoxylon andegavense Crié and P. ligerinum Crié (Crié, 1892), is purportedly from the Turonian of France while there is a slightly later record, Palmoxylon cliffwoodensis Berry, from the Coniacian­Santonian of New Jersey (Berry, 1916a). Fruits are first recorded from the Upper Cretaceous of Brazil (Palmocarpon luisii; Maury, 1930) and from the Early Palaeocene of Greenland (Koch, 1972). Records of Nypa fruits (Nipadites) are first found in the Palaeocene of the US Gulf Coast states, eastern Brazil (Dolianiti, 1955) and north-east Africa [for example, Chandler (1954); Gregor & Hagn (1982)]. Upper Cretaceous­Palaeocene rhizomes (Rhizopalmoxylon huepaciense Cevallos Ferriz & Ricalde-Moreno and R. teguachachiense Cevallos Ferriz & Ricalde-Moreno; Cevallos Ferriz & Ricalde-Moreno, 1995) are described from northern Mexico, while an inflorescence from the lower

Maastrichtian of north-eastern Mexico is possibly the earliest record of an inflorescence structure so far described (Weber, 1978). Spinizonocolpites, widespread from the Maastrichtian (Gee, 1990; Morley, 2000), represents the earliest undisputed palm pollen, but by the Maastrichtian, other palm-like pollen types also appeared, notably Mauritiidites and Longapertites (Schrank, 1994).
By the late Cretaceous all major palm fossil categories are present, and from the earliest Tertiary (Palaeocene) up until the cooling events of the Miocene, fossil records for the Arecaceae are extraordinarily rich and diverse. Nevertheless, for the majority of palm fossils, the lack of distinctive morphological variation in organs frequently limits the possibility of inferring affinity to taxonomic units below the family level. Pollen records are exceptionally numerous and problematic. There are over 50 fossil pollen genera with a clear or suspected affinity to palms. At the other end of the scale, almost all described fossil palm stems are included in the single genus Palmoxylon. In this paper, the main palm fossil categories and their genera are reviewed, and the extent to which relationships can be attributed is considered.
THE FOSSIL GENERA (SEE ALSO APPENDICES 1 & 2)
LEAVES, LEAF AXES, PETIOLES, ETC.
Leaves: Amesoneuron Goeppert, Bactrites Berry, *Calamopsis Heer, Costapalma Daghlian, *Eolirion Schenk, Flabellaria Sternberg, Geonomites Visiani Hemiphoenicites Visiani, Iriartites Berry, Kentites Boureau, Latanites Massalongo, Manicarites Boureau, Palmacites Brongniart, *Palmophyllum Conwentz, *Paloreodoxites Knowlton, Palustrapalma Daghlian, Phoenicites Brongniart (also used for fruits), Pritchardites Boureau, *Propalmophyllum Lignier, Sabalites Saporta (also used for fruits), Sabalophyllum Bonde, *Sanmiguelia Brown, *Serenopsis Hollick [* = doubtfully from a palm (Read & Hickey, 1972)].
Leaf axes, petioles, etc.: Palmocaulon (Deshpande) Menon, Parapalmocaulon Bonde, Phoenicicaulon Bonde, Kumbhojkar & Aher, Sabalocaulon Trivedi & Verma.
Level of affinity possible between fossils and extant taxa Read & Hickey (1972) defined five basic characteristics of extant palm leaves that can be used alone or in various combinations to recognize fossil palm leaves: (1) leaf blade and segments plicate (not always evident in fossil fragments of individual segments); (2) leaf blades pinnately veined and either simple or pinnately

compound in form, or palmately veined and palmatifid in form; (3) leaf segments with a strong, uniform midvein bounded on either side by two orders of parallel veins; (4) a ligule-like structure (hastula) at the apex of the petiole (usually only on the adaxial surface, rarely on both surfaces) where the radiating segments are inserted on the palmate blade; and (5) a wellorganized primary costa (the attenuated continuation of the petiole into the blade of costapalmate and simple blades).
On the basis of the above characteristics Read & Hickey (1972) reviewed a considerable number of palm leaf fossil genera, and many were sunk into synonymy in their revised concept of acceptable genera. They maintained six genera for fossil leaves: Amesoneuron, Bactrites, Sabalites, Palmacites, Phoenicites and the modern genus Phoenix.
Features of the leaves of the modern genera Phoenix [induplicate plication, pinnate, lowermost (proximal) pinnae modified as spines (acanthophylls)] and Sabal (induplicate plication, shortly to prominently costapalmate) are probably the most distinctive characteristics encountered within the fossil palm leaf record. Consequently, these modern generic names, particularly Phoenix, are often applied to fossils. Therefore, Read & Hickey (1972) redefined the fossil genus Phoenicites as pinnate with reduplicate plication and lowermost pinnae not spine-like. Their taxonomic recommendation that Phoenicites should, henceforth, be reserved or applied to non-Phoenix-like pinnate leaves is, perhaps, more than a little confusing to the unwary. Almost as confusing is the case of Sabalites and Sabal. Read & Hickey (1972) did not propose the use of the modern genus Sabal for Sabal-like fossil palm leaves but later Daghlian (1978) described a new species of costapalmate fossil leaf as Sabal dortchii because `on the basis of its gross form and cuticular anatomy . . . it is almost indistinguishable from those [leaves] of other species of . . . this extant genus.'
Preliminary studies in palm leaf fossils by Dilcher (1968) and Daghlian & Dilcher (1971) showed that further morphological distinction can be achieved by studying venation characteristics and, in organically intact leaves, cuticular material.
Earliest records Costapalmate leaves are known from the late Coniacian­early Santonian of South Carolina, USA [Sabalites carolinensis Berry (Berry, 1914a)], the Santonian of New Jersey, USA [S. magothiensis (Berry) Berry (Berry, 1905, 1911)] and the Lower Campanian of Austria [Sabalites longirhachis (Unger) J. Kvadek et Herman (Kvadek & Herman, 2004)].
Pinnate leaves, Phoenicites sp., are known from the Lower Campanian of northern Montana (Crabtree, 1987).

FOSSIL RECORDS FOR ARECACEAE 41

Two types of palm leaves, Sabalites sp. and Phoenicites sp., are reported from the lower Maastrichtian of north-eastern Mexico (Weber, 1978).
The fossil palm leaf, Eolirion primigenium Schenk, from the Cretaceous (Urgonian) of Austria (Schenk, 1869) was reported to be the earliest palm fossil record (Collinson, Boulter & Holmes, 1993). However, Read & Hickey (1972) expressed doubts that this leaf is from a palm. Furthermore, the Urgonian (which is not a chronostratigraphic time stage) set in the Barremian to earliest Aptian of south-eastern France, is a coral limestone facies (http://www.cretaceousfossils.com/ geological_time_scale.htm).
STEMS, RHIZOMES AND ROOTS
Stem `wood': Palmoxylon Schenk. Rhizomes: Rhizopalmoxylon Felix. Bark and thorns: Spinophyllum Huard.
Level of affinity possible between fossils and extant taxa The limited number of genera for palm stems and rhizomes highlights the problem of defining differences in palm stem anatomy which support taxonomic or systematic definition. The problem of the artificial genus Palmoxylon was addressed by Mahabale (1958) and by Kaul (1960), but little resolution was achieved. Kaul (1960) commented that the comparative anatomy of living palm stems remained little understood and, furthermore, that the situation was becoming more and more problematic because of the increasingly large number of different palm fossils that were being discovered which, `. . . unfortunately . . . are never found in organic connection [with one another] to give us some clue to their systematic position . . .'. More recently, Tomlinson (1990) offered a concise explanation of the underlying problem: `. . . developmental features peculiar to the biology of the palm stem tend to transcend systematic differences. This is unfortunate because it means that the numerous fossil palm stems that have been discovered and described are difficult to relate to the modern knowledge of palm systematics.'
There are innumerable records of fossil palm stems, including many from the 19th century that were monographed in `Fossil Palm Woods of the World' (Stenzel, 1904), in which the 43 species of Palmoxylon were divided into four groups: (A) Mauritia-like (four species) (B) Corypha-like (19 species) (C) Cocos-like (18 species) (D) `Radices Palmarum' (roots; two species) plus a fifth group, incertae sedis, of four species. At that time, with the exception of P. astrocaryoides and P. iriarteum (Stenzel, 1904), none of the species names reflected any comparison to extant genera. One

hundred years later, the situation is much the same. Only occasionally is a new species of fossil palm wood described with an epithet suggesting generic affinity, for example, P. livistonoides (Prakash & Ambwani, 1980). Even more unusually, an affinity with the living species Borassus aethiopium Mart. was suggested for P. aschersoni Schenk, from the lower Miocene of Libya (Louvet & Magnier, 1971).
Earliest records The earliest records of fossil stems [Palmoxylon andegavense Crié and P. ligerinum Crié (Crié, 1892)] are, purportedly, from the Turonian of France and a later Coniacian­Santonian record from New Jersey (Palmoxylon cliffwoodensis Berry; Berry, 1916a). Upper Cretaceous­Palaeocene rhizomes (Rhizopalmoxylon huepaciense Cevallos Ferriz & Ricalde-Moreno and R. teguachachiense Cevallos Ferriz & Ricalde-Moreno; Cevallos Ferriz & Ricalde-Moreno, 1995) were described from northern Mexico.
FRUITS, ENDOCARPS AND SEEDS
Fruits: Arecoidocarpon Bonde, Arecopsis Fritel, Astrocaryopsis Fliche, Attaleinites Tuzson, Burtinia Endlicher, Caryotispermum Reid & Chandler, Castellinia Massalongo, Fracastoria Massalongo, Hyphaeneocarpon Bande, Prakash & Ambwani, Nipa Thunberg, Nipadites Bowerbank, Palmocarpon Miquel, Palmospermum Reid & Chandler, Phoenicites Brongniart (also used for leaves), Sabalites Saporta (also used for leaves).
Level of affinity possible between fossils and extant taxa Among the more distinctive fossil fruits, endocarps or seeds are those comparable with Nypa, variously called Burtinia, Castellinia, Fracastoria, Nipa, Nipadites and Nypa. Today most records are referred to Nipa or Nipadites. Rendle (1894) included Burtinia in his revised circumscription of Nipadites (N. burtini), while Tralau (1964), in his revision of the fossil fruits, re-examined many specimens of Castellinia and Fracastoria and included them in Nypa burtini (Brongniart) Ettinghausen. Both Rendle (1894) and Tralau (1964) recognized that the plethora of species described for fossil Nypa fruits (cf. Bowerbank, 1840) was largely due to variability in size and form that they believed fell within the range of variation observed within a single infructescence of extant Nypa fruticans Wurmb.
Phoenix seeds (date `stones') have been recorded from the Tertiary of eastern Texas as Phoenicites occidentalis (Berry, 1914b, 1924); from the middle Eocene of Germany (Geiseltal) as Phoenix hercynica (Mai,

Europe daemo-

norops fruits are recorded in Oligocene lignite deposits

in the UK (Chandler, 1957).

Endocarps of Cocos were described as C. zeylanica

from the Pliocene of New Zealand (Berry, 1926), as

C. sahnii from the Miocene of India (Kaul, 1951) as

C. zeylanica Berry from the Miocene of New Zealand

(Balance, Gregory & Gibson, 1981) and as

C. intertrappea from the Eocene of India (Patil &

Upadhye, 1984). Cocos nucifera fruits are known

from the Pliocene of Australia (Rigby, 1995), and

C. nucifera-like fruits are known from the Tertiary of

India (Tripathi, Mishra & Sharma, 1999).

Other `coconuts' include Palmocarpon acrocomioides

Hollick, P. cetera Hollick, P. exemplare Hollick and

Bactris pseudocuesco Hollick from the Oligocene of

Puerto Rico (Hollick, 1928), Attalea from the Upper

Eocene of Florida (Berry, 1929) and possibly Attalein-

ites from the Oligocene of Hungary (Tuzson, 1913 ­

not seen). Astrocaryopsis sanctae-manchildae from the

Cenomanian of France was described as having

endocarps notably similar to those of some species of

Astrocaryum (Fliche, 1894).

The unilocular ovoid fossil fruit Hyphaeneocarpon

indicum, described by Bande, Prakash & Ambwani

(1982), was considered by the authors definitely to

belong with the `Hyphaene alliance of the Borassoid

group of palms'. Hyphaeneocarpum aegyptiacum

(Vaudois-Miéja & Lejal-Nicol, 1987) was reported from

the Aptian of Egypt. The fruit shape is more ovoid

than pyriform, but fruits of modern Hyphaene are fre-

quently very variable in shape, and modern fruits

should be studied for careful comparison with the fos-

sil (R. Bayton, pers. comm.). Furthermore, given the

very early age for this material, it is not known

whether this record has been thoroughly checked for

accuracy of dating.

Many species of palm fruits and seeds have been

described from the Lower Eocene London Clay flora:

Caryotispermum cantiense, Livistona (?) minima,

Oncosperma (?) anglica, Sabal grandisperma, Serenoa

eocenica, Corypha wilkinsonii, ?Trachycarpus (Chan-

dler, 1978). Also documented were five new species of

Palmospermum (P. excavatum, P. jenkinsi; P. parvum,

P. minimum and P. pusillum; Reid & Chandler, 1933);

nine new species of Palmospermum, as well as a num-

ber of un-named species, were included in Chandler

(1961). Caryota was considered by Reid & Chandler

(1933) to be the `nearest living ally' to Caryotisper-

mum but distinct from it. Characters important for

taxonomic separation of palm seeds recovered from

the London Clay are shape and size, form and position

of the ventral depression, hilum and chalaza; position

of embryo; surface ornamentation and testa structure

(Collinson, 1983).

Earliest records The record of Hyphaeneocarpum aegyptiacum (Vaudois-Miéja & Lejal-Nicol, 1987) from the Aptian of Egypt is the oldest record of palm fruit. The deposits from which Astrocaryopsis sanctae-manchildae was extracted were dated as late Cenomanian (Fliche, 1894), which is considerably older than Aptian. Palmocarpon luisii (Maury, 1930) fossils are first recorded from the Upper Cretaceous of Brazil, and coryphoid fruits and seeds are described from the Early Palaeocene of Greenland (Koch, 1972). Records of Nypa-like fruits are first found in the Palaeocene of Brazil (Dolianiti, 1955) and north-east Africa (Chandler, 1954; Gregor & Hagn, 1982).
RACHILLAE, PEDUNCLES, INFLORESCENCES
AND FLOWERS
Flowers, inflorescences or rachillae: Arecoideostrobus Bonde, Palaeophoenix Saporta, Palaeorachis Saporta, Palaeospathe Unger, Palmanthium Schimper, Palmostrobus Mahabalé, Tuzsonia Andreánszky. Peduncle(s): Palmostroboxylon arengoidum Ambwani.
Level of affinity possible between fossils and extant taxa The paucity of fossil flowers and inflorescences (or infructescences) has resulted in only a few form genera. Occasionally fossils can be assigned with some confidence to modern genera. For example, fossil palm flowers in mid to late Tertiary Dominican and Mexican amber were assigned to Trithrinax (T. dominicana) and Socratea (S. brownii) (Poinar, 2002).
A fossil flower from the Tertiary of Germany was assigned to Phoenix as P. eichleri (Conwentz, 1886), and le Marquis de Saporta (1889) described Palaeorachis gracilis, an inflorescence `Peut-être mâle', as presumably being related to the leaf fossil Sabal major Unger.
It seems extraordinary that palm flowers, which are usually very small and often have tough `woody' petals, are rarely recovered, especially given the huge production of flowers in many palms. Corner (1966) observed that male flowers `. . . are so cheap that they are discarded in enormous numbers to make a mulch round the base of the trunk.' Male palm flowers tend to abscise rapidly following anthesis and therefore fossil rachillae rarely have male flowers attached (Andreánszky, 1949). A rare exception is the recovery from the Eocene Messel oil shales of numerous (several thousands) compression fossils of palm flowers. Five types were identified, two of which were associated in inflorescences. Small fruits, infructescences and, less frequently, leaves have also been recovered at the site (Schaarschmidt & Wilde, 1986), which is probably the

FOSSIL RECORDS FOR ARECACEAE 43

largest single find of fossil palm flowers and flowerrelated fossils. Several palm taxa seem to be represented. The flowers are usually male or female; hermaphrodite flowers are less evident. Affinities are difficult to establish because of the rather generalized flower morphology. Furthermore, due to compression it is difficult or almost impossible to study the female organs. However, many of the male flowers have pollen-rich anthers from which it has been possible to establish differences in the morphology of the monosulcate grains (Harley, 1997). One type seems to be Phoenix-like, although the floral morphology does not strongly support this (J. Dransfield, pers. comm.); while the exine of the other type is similar to that of pollen in some species of two arecoid genera, Dictyocaryum and Dypsis.
Earliest records A fruiting palm inflorescence compared with Manicaria (Weber, 1978) from the lower Maastrichtian of north-eastern Mexico is possibly the earliest record of a floral structure so far described. However, Weber (1978) stated that `The fossil inflorescence will be described elsewhere as a new genus.' The publication of the new genus has not yet been traced. The record of Palmostrobus (Mahabalé, 1950) from the flood basalts of the Deccan Intertrappean, which are probably Maastrichtian in age (Vandamme et al., 1991), is possibly of similar age. All other records appear to be Eocene.
MIXED ORGANS
Calamus daemonorops (Unger) Chandler This modern generic name, with another modern generic name as a species epithet published by Chandler (1957), has been applied to a variety of calamoidlike structures including: fragments of fruiting axes, fruits, seeds, flowers, spines and spine bases and pollen (Chandler, 1957, 1963).

Level of affinity possible between fossils and extant taxa ­ selected examples (see Appendix 2 for more detail) Most palms have simple tectate, monosulcate pollen (Harley, 1990). Nevertheless, there are some very distinctive exine and aperture types in the family (Harley & Baker, 2001), many of which are also found in fossil palm pollen.
Arengapollenites Kar (1985) from the Lower Eocene of India is monosulcate, ellipsoid (long axis c. 60 µm), with a sulcus the length of the long axis, intectate and sparsely spinose except along colpus margines where the spines are arranged so that they interlock on invagination of the sulcus. An affinity with Arenga pollen is widely accepted.
Dicolpopollis Pflanzl (1956), including Disulcites, Disulcipollenites and Disulcipollis, is a fossil pollen form highly comparable with some extant, equatorially disulcate palm pollen. Equatorially disulcate pollen occurs in eight extant calamoid genera: Metroxylon, Plectocomia, Myrialepis, Plectocomiopsis, Calamus, Retispatha, Daemonorops and Ceratolobus. The collective distribution of the extant genera includes South-east Asia, India, Burma, south China, Africa (humid tropics), New Guinea, Queensland and the Philippines. Dicolpopollis (Ediger, Bati & Alisan, 1990) has been recorded from the Palaeocene of Malaysia and has been widely recorded from the Eocene of northern India and Burma, France, Hungary and Germany. There are records from the Oligocene-Miocene of northern India, Turkey and England.
Jacobipollis Ramanujam (1966) has been described from the Indian Miocene. According to the revised description, based on additional material, the longest

axis is 40­100 µm, the pore is circular to slightly elongate 10­25 µm, and it has a `rugged' tectate margo (Ramanujam, Reddy & Ramakrishna, 1998). The authors make convincing comparisons with Borassodendron; the only alternative in the palms would be Ammandra with closely similar pollen. Borassodendron machadonis pollen has been reported from the Pliocene-early Quaternary of the Mahakam Delta, Kalimantan by Caratini & Tissot (1985).
Longapertites Van Hoeken-Klinkenberg (1964) was originally described from the Maastrichtian of Nigeria. There are isolated examples of species with extended sulcate pollen among recent palms: Calamoideae (Eugeissona, Eremospatha), Coryphoideae (Licuala all spp.), and Arecoideae (Areca, Pinanga and Hydriastele). In the fossil literature records of Longapertites are numerous, and it is likely that a proportion of these are from palms. However, some Longapertites probably represent equatorial disulcate (disulculate) pollen with a broken distal `bridge', as frequently happens in extant disulculate palm pollen. Extended sulcate pollen may have arisen via loss of the distal bridge (Harley & Baker, 2001) or, alternatively, via the extended sulcate model by development of a distal bridge.
Mauritiidites Van Hoeken-Klinkenberg (1964), like Longapertites, was originally described from the Maastrichtian of Nigeria. Spiny palm pollen is sporadic but widespread in the family, and the spines take many forms. Nowhere are the spines more bizarre than in the tropical South American subtribe Mauritiinae (sensu Dransfield et al., 2005), where they are `rooted' into depressions in the ectexine (for example, Ferguson & Harley, 1993; Jaramillo & Dilcher, 2001; Rull, 2001). However, only in Mauritia are there distinct swellings of the inner margin of the foot layer beneath each spine. The pollen grains are large, and the swellings are clearly visible in light microscopy. The fossil counterparts are easily recognizable, and the association with Mauritia is widely accepted. The palaeo-distribution in Africa (Salard-Cheboldaeff, 1978, 1981; Schrank, 1994) and South America (Rull, 1998, 2001; Jaramillo & Dilcher, 2001), as opposed to its current restriction to South America, is of particular interest.
Monocolpopollenites Pflug & Thomson (Thomson & Pflug, 1953) was originally described from the Eocene of Germany. This genus has been widely adopted for fossil monosulcate pollen grains, and records are extensive and geographically widespread in the Tertiary. However, this taxon was erected strictly for distinctly asymmetric monosulcate monocot-like fossil pollen (e.g. Harley & Morley, 1995). Asymmetric monosulcate pollen is very common in the palms, especially in the Arecoideae but also, to a lesser extent, in the Coryphoideae. Unfortunately, the genus

has been over-used for dispersed fossil monosulcate pollen whether symmetric or asymmetric; therefore, records have to be checked carefully for palm-like qualities.
Quilonipollenites (Rao & Ramanujam, 1978) was originally described from the Neogene Quilon Beds of Kerala, southern India. The large (long axis: 50­ 55 µm) extended sulcate pollen, with a thick, semi tectate exine, and coarse reticulum with smaller lumina around the aperture margo, is now widely accepted as having an affinity with some extant species of Eugeissona (E. tristis, E. utilis) (Phadtare & Kulkarni, 1984). The palaeodistribution is of particular interest in view of the Early Tertiary collision of the Indian plate with Asia. Based on the fossil pollen records, the West Malesian genus Eugeissona is thought to be Indian in origin. In India, Quilonipollenites is recorded from the Neyveli lignites (Phadtare & Kulkarni, 1984) which are considered to be Early to middle Eocene in age (Saxena, 1992; Morley, 2000).
Spinizonocolpites Muller (1968) includes a considerable number of described species, but the most frequently encountered morphology is that of S. echinatus and S. baculatus Muller (1968), which were originally known from the Late Cretaceous (or Late Palaeocene; Morley, 2000) of Sarawak. The spiny zonasulcate pollen is usually found as one half of the original spheroidal grain, due to breakdown of the aperture membrane during fossilization. Pollen records are globally widespread from the Maastrichtian, reaching a crescendo in the Eocene, after which records gradually reduce until, by the Early Miocene, records are more or less restricted to South-east Asia; presumably in response to continental movement, and also to less favourable climate changes. Spinizonocolpites is widely accepted as ancestral to the modern genus Nypa, with a South-east Asian distribution. Spinizonocolpites fossils appear to represent more than one species, but extant Nypa is monotypic.
Trichotomosulcites Couper (1953) was originally described from the Cretaceous of New Zealand. The pollen was compared with Phormium (Phormiaceae), and given its type locality, this association is accepted. However, this pollen form is very common in the palms, especially in the arecoid palms, and also in the Asparagales, where there is a large clade of genera (Chase, Rudall & Conran, 1996) including Phormium, with trichomosulcate pollen. It may be time to consider the re-circumscription of Trichotomosulcites to embrace a wider application for fossil monocot pollen. In retrospect, it is amusing to reconsider the comment that, `many monosulcate pollen (Liliaceae, Palmae) contain abnormal trichotomosulcate pollen . . . a form genus for such atavistic, teratological forms is superfluous.' (Krutzsch, 1970).

FOSSIL RECORDS FOR ARECACEAE 45

Earliest records Spinizonocolpites, widespread from the Maastrichtian (Gee, 1990; Morley, 2000), represents the earliest undisputed palm pollen but, by the Maastrichtian, other palm-like pollen types had also appeared, notably Mauritiidites and Longapertites (Schrank, 1994).
CONCLUSIONS
The Arecaceae are extremely well represented in the fossil record. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to suppose that, for any one geological epoch, the fossil record represents no more than a tantalizingly small proportion of the species which comprised the family during that time. By the Late Cretaceous, leaves, stems, fruits, inflorescences and pollen, unequivocally representing the Arecaceae, are present. By this time, within each organ category, there is a range of variation denoting a well established lineage, rather than a recently emerged family. Earliest unequivocal fossil records disallow speculation, and yet the earliest fossils, for example for pollen, Spinizonocolpites and Mauritiidites ­ both spiny but with strikingly different ultrastructure ­ cannot represent the most ancient palms. Therefore, if forms like these were already in place by the Maastrichtian, an earlier origin for Arecaceae is surely more likely.
The pollen of Nenga gajah J. Dransf. has a very unusual spinulose reticulum which is more or less detached from the underlying foot layer (Kesseler & Harley, 2004). This phenomenon is intriguing, as it is reminiscent of similar reticulate ectexine pollen encountered in the earlier Cretaceous, such as the monosulcate Brenneripollis from the Albian of the North American Atlantic Coastal Plain and Northern Europe (Juhász & Góczán, 1985) and the inaperturate Afropollis from Africa (Doyle, Jardiné & Doerenkamp, 1982). Some records from the English Barremian­ Aptian are of loosely reticulate, spinulose monosulcate pollen (Hughes, 1994) and are particularly reminiscent of Nenga pollen. Although an unequivocal association with Nenga or any other palm is ruled out, it would appear that pollen with a coarse, loosely attached, reticulum was more common in some early evolving angiosperm groups than in extant angiosperms.
Finally, the serendipitous nature of fossil recovery and the limits it imposes on the range and quantity of recovered fossils have to be considered. Cretaceous and Tertiary palaeobotany relies mainly on working with cores and bedding planes made available by natural events, or drilling, mining and quarrying. Pollen is less affected by these limitations than macro fossil organs but also shares a richer Northern than Southern Hemisphere record, a reflection of the more extensive drilling and mining activity of the Northern Hemisphere. Nevertheless, it is probably only a mat-

ter of time before unequivocal palm fossils predating the Turonian are discovered. Emberger (1960) suggested that there are palm stem fossils in the Upper Jurassic, but this may be a step too far.

Monoporate slightly oblate-spheroidal (LA 40­55 µm), exine reticulate except in area surrounding pore. Comparable with pollen of Borassodendron machadonis, but smaller.
Subequatorial triporate, sometimes with cryptotrichotomosulcus, tectate, rounded triangular (LA 20­50 µm), planaperturate. Some similarity to Constantinisporis, but pores set further in from margin. No further comment on affinity.
Small monosulcate grain (LA 23­25 µm). Possible coryphoid type palm.
Monosulcate, ellipsoid (LA c. 60 µm), sulcus length as long axis, sparsely spinose except along colpus margines where the spines are arranged so that they interlock on invagination of aperture. Affinity with Arenga accepted.
Pollen in equatorial view the typical trapezium of invaginated disulcate pollen (LA 23­29 µm) distinct, finely reticulate sculpture. Most probably referable to calamoid palms, perhaps should placed in the synonomy of Dicolpopollis.

Palms
`. . . perhaps corresponds in transitional terms to ancient palms ­ Problematicopalmites' Belsky & Boltenhagen (1963) None

Monosulcate (LA 49­69 µm) with conspicuous and prominent clavate sculpture, probably intectate. Clavate monosulcate pollen occurs in Caryota, Arenga and Pinanga (intectate); and in Pinanga and Oncosperma (supratectate).
Extended sulcate, ellipsoid (LA 25­31 µm), with suprareticulate clavae. Possibly a disulcate calamoid with fractured distal `bridge', suprareticulate clavae are found in disulcate Daemonorops.
Subequatorial triporate with cryptotrichotomosulcus, circular equatorial outline (LA 20­50 µm), pores circular to oval. Some similarity to Andreisporis but pores closer to margin. No further comment on affinity.
Monosulcate (LA 34­44 µm) tectate, spinose, sulcus length as long axis. There are examples of monosulcate tectate, as well as imtectate, spinose palm pollen. Spinose pollen ultrastructure is very varied in the Arecaceae.

Equatorial disulculate, small to medium forms, reticulate, verrucate or granular exine. Widely accepted as disulculate Calamus type ­ however, there are eight palm genera which share this pollen type (see text).
Equatorial disulcate (LA 30­37 µm), smooth or finely punctate exine. Widely accepted as disulculate Calamus type ­ however, there are two other genera where equatorial psilate perforate disulculate pollen occur: Calamus & Daemonorops.

Lower to Middle Eocene, India None

Eocene, Colombia

Small, monosulcate (colpus not very well defined), spinose (LA 27 µm). Could have an affinity with palms ­ there are a number of examples of monosulcate tectate, as well as imtectate, spinose palm pollen. (Spinose pollen ultrastructure is very varied in the Arecaceae).
Spherical to brevi ellipsoid (LA 30­46 µm), large circular to oval pore with unthickened margo, exine thin, tectate and spinose, interspinal exine punctate to microreticulate. Superficial resemblance to Ravenea (Ceroxyloideae) however, pollen of this genus has a thicker exine in relation to overall pollen size.
Monosulcate (LA 59­65 µm), with two/three types of sculptural elements, spines being the most frequent (1­4 µm), exine thin relative to overall size (1.5 µm). Possibly an affinity with palms ­ there are examples of monosulcate tectate, as well as intectate, spinose palm pollen. Spinose pollen ultrastructure is very varied in the Arecaceae. However, an endexine is remarked ­ if this observation is correct, it is not typical of palm pollen, or monocot pollen in general.

Monosulcate, sulcus as long axis (LA 77 µm), microfoveolate with thin exine cf. to overall size. Largest palm pollen, LA 70­90 µm, foveolate exines do occur ­ could be from an ancestral palm.
Monosulcate, irregularly micro gemmate (LA 22.5 µm). Small monosulcate pollen (LA <35 µm) occur commonly in Coryphoideae, and less frequently in Arecoideae ­ not possible to establish any clear affinity with palms.
Aperture absent or indistinct (LA 40­62 µm), thin walled with finely baculate scabrate surface and very long (7­ 10 µm) widely spaced clavae, swollen apices, and bases sunken into locally thickened `endexine'. This fossil often considered to have some affinity to Spinizonocolpites. However, the inwardly bulging `endexine' towards the spines is much more reminiscent of the situation in Mauritiidites ­ perhaps the endexine is actually foot layer, and the fossil has an affinity to Mauritia and its relatives.

Borassodendron (Ramanujam et al., 1998)
None
Compared with Dicolpopollis, but accepting that apices nearest to the distal pollen have merged (in an evolutionary sense) to form an elongated sulcus.

Spheroidal (LA 38.5­48 µm), monoporate, pore 5­10 µm, semi tectate, coarsely reticulate. Revised description based on further material (Ramanujam et al., 1998) ­ size, LA 40­100 µm, pore, circular to slightly elongate 10­25 µm, with a rugged tectate margo. The comparisons of Ramanujam et al. (1998) with Borassodendron are convincing, the only alternative in the palms would be Ammandra with closely similar pollen.
Trichotomosulcate (LA 16 µm), tectate, microfoveolate. Attention is drawn to this fossil mainly because the angiosperm-like trichotomosulcus is a feature of the pollen of many palms. However, the small size of the pollen suggests that it is possibly from an early dicotyledonous plant.
There are isolated examples of species with extended sulcate pollen in recent palms ­ Calamoideae (Eugeissona, Eremospatha); Coryphoideae (Licuala all spp.); Arecoideae (Areca, Pinanga, Hydriastele). In the fossil literature records of Longapertites are numerous and it is very likely that many of these are from ancestral palms, but are actually disulculate pollen with a broken distal `bridge'.

Monosulcate pollen.

Originally Eocene, Germany ­ however, a widely adopted genus for asymmetric monosulcate fossil pollen grains, and records extensive, and widespread in the Tertiary.

Originally none, but now widely accepted as palm-like. However, the genus has been widely used, and often misapplied, over the years for monosulcate pollen generally, with inattention to the asymmetric form of the type species.

Monosulcate, generally asymmetric with regard to overall shape, and often also in relation to aperture shape, aperture usually slightly shorter than long axis. Tectate and, usually, psilate, perforate finely rugulate. Original size given as 24 µm, however, Nichols et al. (1973) suggest a range of 20­50 µm, which is more realistic. Strictly this taxon was erected for distinctly asymmetric monsulcate monocot-like fossil pollen ­ as such it is decidedly palm-like ­ especially Arecoideae or, to a lesser extent, Coryphoideae.
Monosulcate pollen.

`?Lower Tertiary' [Palaeocene], Gingkoales New Zealand

Monosulcate, elliptic in outline (LA 29­34 µm), strong exine. Small monosulcate pollen (LA <35 µm) occur commonly in Coryphoideae, and less frequently in Arecoideae ­ not possible to form strong conclusions regarding affinity.

Monosulcate (LA 50­88 µm) sulcus length as long axis, psilate perforate. If a palm affinity is correct then it is most likely to be with ceroxyloid or arecoid palms.
Ellipsoid and zonasulcate, the aperture divides the grain into two more or less equal halves (LA 22.5­29 µm), intectate, densely pilate-clavate. Being a dispersed grain it is not possible to know whether the zonasulcus is orientated meridionally or equatorially relative to the poles. Similar pollen occur in Korthalsia (Calamoideae).
Pollen ellipsoid with two large pores, one on either short axis (LA 48­55 µm), gemmate (not pilate as inferred from name), margine of pore described as `spinose' not clear from images ­ probably the ragged margo of the pore, exine thick (2­4 µm). No obvious affinity in palms but, could be a modification of distal disulcate. Diporate forms are known in Daemonorops and Korthalsia, but the pores are comparatively small and discrete.

`not comparable to any known fossil or living genera in its apertural condition.'

More or less zonasulcate (LA c. 50 µm) ­ however, one half slightly larger than other, exine thin, microfoveolate to foveolate. In the original description the grains are described as having `a big wide aperture' at the proximal side of the grain, the illustrations show a zonasulcate grain ­ possibly one half of the grain was interpreted as an operculum. The comparison with Astrocaryum pollen is erroneous ­ here the pollen is mono- or trichotomosulcate. In the palms pollen grains showing notable similarity to Proxapertites occur in a few species of Areca. They also occur, and much more frequently, in the Araceae where monosulcate or zonate account for the majority of aperturate genera.
Pollen ellipsoid with two large pores, one on either short axis (LA 42­55 µm), psilare, margin of pore described as `spinose' not clear from images ­ probably the ragged margo of the pore, exine thick (2­5 µm).

Monosulcate, aperture length as, or slightly less than long axis (33 µm), exine thin, psilate perforate. Illustrated pollen appears to slightly extended sulcate ­ could be from a palm, see comments under entry for Longapertites.
Extended sulcate (LA 50­55 µm), tectate, coarsely reticulate ­ lumina smaller around aperture margo. Now widely accepted as having an affinity with some extant species of Eugeissona (E. tristis, E. utilis) which have closely similar pollen (Phadtare & Kulkarni, 1984).
Monosulcate (LA 30­40 µm), probably intectate, gemmate, baculate or clavate sculpture. Uncertain, but could have a palm affinity.

`not comparable to any known fossil or living genera in its apertural condition.'

Pollen ellipsoid with two large pores, one on either short axis (LA 33­42 µm), finely reticulate, finer around aperture margos, exine (c. 2.5 µm). No obvious affinity in palms, could be a modification of distal disulcate. Diporate forms are known in Daemonorops and Korthalsia, and in Calamus there are many species with reticulate disulcate pollen, in some cases the distal exine area is wide, and the sulci short.

`closely resembles Miocene Sclerosperma-type pollen (Médus, 1975) from Senegal, western Africa.'
`we suppose that this type of pollen grain may be associated to the Gymnospermeae of the Gingko-group or to Palmae'

Monosulcate, aperture almost encircles grain, ellipsoidal to spherical (LA c. 27 µm), tectate, finely reticulate, occasionally separated from endexine; exine c. 1.5 µm. Small zonasulcate pollen grains occur in the calamoid palms (Salacca & Korthalsia) reticulate forms not known. If the endexine is indeed endexine and not a foot layer, it suggests that the pollen is more likely to be from an early dicot.
Triporate, triangular in presumed polar view, straight or slightly convex faces (LA 24­41 µm) triangular or rounded triangular, reticulate, exine 2­4 µm thick. More Sclerosperma-like than Dorreenipites or Trilatiporites, but walls too thick, and pore position not quite right ­ altogether not as convincing as the Senegal examples.
Monosulcate (LA 25 µm), sulcus length as long axis. Uncertain, but could have a palm affinity.

Monosulcate (LA 36­41 µm), sulcus length as long axis, perforate to reticulate. Sabalpollenites is used for small to average more or less bisymmetric monosulcate coryphoid-like pollen ­ many of the comparisons seem convincing.
Zonasulcate, usually only found as one half of the original spheroidal grain, due to breakdown of aperture during fossilisation (LA 33­43 µm), tectate, exine perforate to finely reticulate with short to long spines. Widely accepted as ancestral to Nypa, and possibly once represented by a number of species.

Age of type material

the holotype of the type species ­ T. normalis ­ `is a recent pollen grain of Pyrenoglyphis major (Jacq.) Karst (Palmae).' (Pyrenoglyphis syn. Bactris). Thus Trichotomocolpites, by designation of the type species is made illegitimate and a later synonym of Pyrenoglyphis (see Jansonius & Hills, 1976).

Trichotomosulcate, sulcus 3armed, subcircular to triangular outline (LA 27­ 35 µm), psilate-granular. Common in Cretaceous of New Zealand ­ but these probably more likely to be ancestral to Phormiaceae than Palmae. Nevertheless, asymmetric, less frequently symmetric, trichotomosulcate pollen is very common in the palms, especially in subfamily Arecoideae.
Heteropolar, triporate protrudent with thickened rim (LA 29­48 µm) suboblate, tectate. This pollen form is closely similar to Dorreenpites; it is not considered to have any association with Arecaceae (Harley & Baker, 2001).

`differs from Liliacidites mostly in the shape of the pollen and the colpus'

Subequatorial porotrichotomosulcus, tectate, rounded triangular equatorial outline (LA 20­ 50 µm), pores circular to oval. Some similarity to Andreisporis but pores closer to margin, and set in the angles of the triangular outline. There are a number of reasons why this is unlikely to be ancestral to Sclerosperma (Harley & Baker, 2001). Probably should also be referred to Problematicopalmites with Andreisporis & Constantinisporis.
Monosulcate broad ellipsoidal (LA 34­46 µm), sulcus wide with broad apices, semi tectate, coarsely reticulate, sparsely columellate, lumina reduced to perforations around sulcus margo. Closely similar grains found in some species of Hydriastele.
